All For One React Rebuild
Recreated the All For One project using React and Bootstrap.

Peer Review, Sebastian Breve-Sanchez: The website is fully functional. Every endpoint returns a response and endpoints where a number is needed but not inputted returns the appropriate response. I will say on the Mad-Libs, you should add padding or margin to the sides of the text if possible. On tablet, if you can, try to line up the buttons on the home page so that they are not unaligned, same with the input boxes (Madlibs for example). On the mobile homepage, it would be nice if there was some margin between the buttons instead of them being right next to each other, if possible. 
On the code side of things, there are still IDs in the HTML components, you can remove those since they are not needed. The choice to have seperate CSS files is interesting, I'm sure you have your reasons but condencing them down to a single CSS file would be ideal. Overall the site works, solid job.
